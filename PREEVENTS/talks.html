              Modeling wildfires, energy production, and air pollution propagation in cities require high-resolution wind fields. QES-Winds is a 
              fast-response 3D diagnostic wind model written in C++, based on the well-used FORTRAN code, QUIC-URB (Quick Urban and Industrial 
              Complex-Urban module). Incorporating the concept of dynamic parallelism in CUDA, QES-Winds significantly accelerates the computation 
              of wind fields. QES-Winds’ GPU-based solver is ~128 times faster than the equivalent CPU (Computing Processing Unit, not 
              parallelized) solver for a domain using 144 million cells. <br><br>
              
              As a result, QES-Winds can be used for prediction (model run-times 
              should be near or faster than real-time) or design optimization (thousands of simulations must be performed in a short period of 
              time) for larger domains. To improve wind modeling in urban areas and in mountainous regions, we have added a higher-order 
              geometrical representation of both buildings (most important in urban environments) and terrain (important for wind energy and 
              wildfires). We use the cut-cell method, which provides the capability of having cells partially cut by solid surfaces. The cut-cell 
              method is able to capture more building and terrain geometry details compared with standard QUIC-URB’s “block buildings” or 
              stair-step approach.

              "<em>Evaluating Beer's law for leaf area density estimation in homogeneous and heterogeneous canopies</em>" by Halubok, M. and Bailey, B.N.
            </p>

            <p style="font-size: 1.2rem;">Plant canopy structure plays an important role in shaping energy and mass exchange fluxes, particularly in heterogeneous environments. 
              Thus, accurately quantifying variability in canopy structure is critical for various environmental models (e.g., wildfire models, ecosystem 
              models, remote sensing inversion) and for interpreting ecosystem flux measurements. Use of remote-sensing-based platforms along with active 
              sensing (e.g., LiDAR) has become almost routine for characterizing canopy structure. However, translating this raw data into useful model 
              inputs, and quantifying associated errors, has remained a challenge. This is largely due to the inability to obtain robust, detailed manual 
              measurements over large scales for methodological development and validation. <br><br>

              In this work, we present a new method for estimation of 3D leaf area density (LAD) distributions from aerial LiDAR data, applicable to 
              canopies with sparse through optically-thick vegetation. In order to rigorously evaluate the proposed approach for a wide range of canopy 
              architectures, scan densities, and grid resolutions, we generated an array of 3D virtual plant canopies in which the exact LAD distributions 
              were known, and used the algorithm to estimate LAD from simulated or "synthetic" LiDAR scan data for these canopies.<br><br>

              Our results indicated that for homogeneous and isotropic cases, agreement between estimated and reference LAD values improved as the voxel size 
              increases, which is reflected in the overall decrease of normalized RMSE - from 95-100% at voxel size of 1×1×1 m<sup>3</sup> to 5-14% at 
              10×10×10 m<sup>3</sup> under scan density of 10 points/m<sup>2</sup> comparable to that of real-life aerial LiDAR instrumentation; mean bias demonstrated 
              a similar decreasing trend. A two-fold increase in scan density lead to only a slight improvement in LAD estimation in terms of RMSE. In case of heterogeneous 
              canopies, error in LAD estimates increases as plant spacing increases for large voxel sizes, in which case a clumping correction is also needed. 
              Overall, the ultimate goal of this research study was to provide some form of quantification of the resulting errors in LAD estimates for a 
              given combination of factors (e.g., scan density, voxel size, canopy density).</p><br><br>
