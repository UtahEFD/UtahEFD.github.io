Main Utah EDF Page: [Utah EFD Pages](https://utahefd.github.io/)

# A couple notes about the website's design:

* Bootstrap is *NOT* installed and used for the PREEVENTS website. However, it was installed for index.html for a cleaner page than what I originally created before. This may lead to difficulty later if a page gets added and needs mobile optimization. All pages have, or will be quality checked for mobile optimization.

* There is thorough documentation in the .html, .css, and .js files. If you need to find an attribute to change, the comments may provide you some guidance. Especially in the .css files. 

* A template webpage is available, which will provide some "fill-in-the-blank" lines that you may use to include more pages. Please read the top comments on the .html file for some words of caution/consideration to know before creating a new webpage.

More documentation may be added or removed later.
