# A couple notes about the website's design:

* Bootstrap is *NOT* installed and used for this website. This may lead to complications later if a page gets added and needs mobile optimization. All pages have (or will be) quality checked for mobile optimization. This will make it easy to copy and paste a page, then use it for a template.

* There is thorough documentation in the .html, .css, and .js files. If you need to find an attribute to change, the comments may provide you some guidance. Especially in the .css files. 

* A template webpage will be available soon, which will provide some "fill-in-the-blank" lines that you may use to include more pages. However, a word of caution with creating more websites: The menu will need to handle overflow of buttons. There are currently five buttons in the menu, and adding more may lead to complications on smaller devices.

More documentation may be added or removed later.
